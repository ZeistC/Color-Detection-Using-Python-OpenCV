# Colour Detection using Pandas & OpenCV Project
Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, the detection and classification of local structures (i.e. edges, corners, and T-Junctions). Color images is important for many applications such as image segmentation, image matching, object recognition, visual tracking in the fields of image processing and computer vision, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps.
## About this project :
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which the user can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
## Dataset used :
The colors.csv file that we included has 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values. This is gonna be our dataset and I got it from GitHub.
